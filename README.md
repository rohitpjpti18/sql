- download your prefered version of "DB browser for SQLite" from https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
- create new database in it. then first execute createUniversityTable.sql 
- then execute insertUniversityData.sql
- now you have a database of university ready in sqlite3. you can now create your own queries for practices in this database

**Note:- if you don't wish to create your own database then simply download "DB browser for SQLite" and use "university.db" for practicing queries.**

*this repository is meant for practicing sql with reference to the book "database system concepts by Abraham Silberschatz Henry F. Korth S. Sudarshan" and is not meant to make sense outside of it*
